    - What is machine learning?

    - In this video, we will try to define what it is and also try to get a sense
      of when you want to use machine learning.

    - Even among machine learning&nbsp;practitioners, there isn't a well-accepted
      definition of what is and what isn't machine learning.

    - Let me show you a couple of examples of the ways that people have tried to define
      it.

    - Here's a definition of "what is machine learning" due to Arthur Samuel.

  - - '535'
    - He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability
      to learn without being explicitly programmed.

  - - '536'
    - Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote a checkers playing
      program.
    - '2012-03-28 06:50:07'

    - '38.6824989318848'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '537'
    - And the amazing thing about this checkers playing program was that Arthur Samuel
      himself wasn't a good checkers player.

    - '45.6690673828125'
    - '33'
    - '2'

    - What he did was he had the program play tens of thousands of games against itself,

    - '49.804'

    - and by what sorts of board positions tended to lead to wins, and what sort of
      board positions tended to be to losses,

    - '56.5637092590332'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '540'
    - the checkers playing program learned over time what are good board positions,
      and what are bad board positions
    - '2012-03-28 06:51:28'
    - '2012-03-28 06:53:10'

    - '62.8639689351723'

  - - '541'
    - and eventually learned to play checkers better than Arthur Samuel himself was
      able to.

    - '67.6317977905273'

  - - '542'
    - This was a remarkable result. Arthur Samuel himself turned out not to be a very
      good checkers player

    - but because the computer has the patience to play tens of thousands of games
      against itself

  - - '547'
    - This is a somewhat informal definition, and an older one.

    - Here's a slightly more recent definition by Tom Mitchell, who's a friend over
      at Carnegie Mellon.
    - '2012-03-28 06:56:23'
    - '2012-03-28 06:56:42'

    - '101.261451721191'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '549'
    - So Tom defines machine learning by saying that -
    - '2012-03-28 06:56:46'
    - '2012-03-28 06:57:18'
    - '0'
    - '101.827110290527'
    - '105.000648498535'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '550'
    - the well-posed learning problem is defined as follows.
    - '2012-03-28 06:57:21'
    - '2012-03-28 06:58:12'
    - '0'
    - '105.192886352539'
    - '107.665614401647'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '551'
    - He says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect
      to some task T and some performance measure P,
    - '2012-03-28 06:57:54'
    - '2012-03-28 06:58:47'
    - '0'
    - '108.19685920955'
    - '115.093580095781'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '552'
    - if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
    - '2012-03-28 06:58:56'
    - '2012-03-28 06:59:26'
    - '0'
    - '115.236'
    - '120.211'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '553'
    - I actually think he came up with this definition just to make it rhyme.
    - '2012-03-28 06:59:29'
    - '2012-03-28 07:00:01'
    - '0'
    - '120.450012207031'
    - '123.913772583008'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '554'
    - For the checkers-playing example, the experience E would be the experience of
      having the program play tens of thousands of games against itself.
    - '2012-03-28 07:00:07'
    - '2012-03-28 07:01:20'

    - '132.415191650391'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '555'
    - The task T would be the task of playing checkers,
    - '2012-03-28 07:00:50'
    - '2012-03-28 07:01:38'
    - '0'

    - '136'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '556'
    - and the performance measure P would be the probability that it wins the next
      game of checkers against some opponent.

    - Throughout these videos, besides me trying to teach you stuff, I'll ask you
      a question to make sure you understand the content.

    - On top is the definition of machine learning, by Tom Mitchell --

    - Let's say your email program watches which emails you do or do not flag as spam,
      so
    - '2012-03-28 07:05:22'
    - '2012-03-28 07:05:47'
    - '0'
    - '157.661117553711'
    - '162.663177490234'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '560'
    - an email program like this you might click this spam button to report some email
      as spam but not other emails.

    - '169.619018554688'
    - '33'

  - - '562'
    - And, based on which emails you mark as spam, say your email program learns better
      how to filter spam email.
    - '2012-03-28 07:06:50'

  - - '563'
    - What is the task T in this setting?
    - '2012-03-28 07:07:33'
    - '2012-03-28 07:07:44'

    - In a few seconds, the video will pause, and when it does so, you can use your
      mouse to select one of these four radio buttons,

    - '188.929656982422'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '565'
    - to let me know which of these four you think is the right answer to this question.
    - '2012-03-28 07:08:27'
    - '2012-03-28 07:08:50'

    - '193.855224609375'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '566'
    - So, hopefully you got that this is the right answer - classifying emails is
      the task T.

    - '201.523077160221'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '567'
    - This definition defines a task T and a performance measure P,
    - '2012-03-28 07:09:48'
    - '2012-03-28 07:10:34'
    - '0'
    - '202.261184692383'
    - '205.679260253906'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '568'
    - and this experience E,
    - '2012-03-28 07:10:34'
    - '2012-03-28 07:10:51'
    - '0'
    - '206.093292236328'
    - '209.227645874023'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '569'
    - and so watching you label emails as spam or not spam, this would be the experience
      E,
    - '2012-03-28 07:10:54'
    - '2012-03-28 07:12:24'
    - '0'
    - '210.0107421875'
    - '216.347610473633'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '570'
    - and the fraction of emails correctly classified; that might be your performance
      measure P.
    - '2012-03-28 07:11:35'
    - '2012-03-28 07:12:41'

    - '221.978284295119'
    - '33'
    - '2'
  - - '572'
    - and so, our task performance - our system's performance on the task T on the
      performance measure P will improve after the experience E.
